      <p id="name"><b>Andrew Larsen – programmer, head of marketing, and project manager</b></p>  
      <p id="description">Andrew has always dreamed of owning his own business. His experience in software development
      and love of video games motivated him to start Citadel Games and form this team. His go-to games 
      are Pokémon, The Legend of Zelda, and anything with Mario in it.</p>

      <p id="name"><b>Micah Rogers – lead programmer</p></b>  
      <p id="description">Micah started game development as part of his education as a software engineer. 
      When he isn’t crushing everyone at Super Smash Bros, he spends his time squashing 
      programming bugs and complaining about how lame writing is. He believes that 
      Metroid Prime and Luigi’s Mansion are two of the most beautifully crafted games ever.</p>

      <p id="name"><b>Roger Pollard – music producer, web developer</p></b>  
      <p id="description">Roger has been writing music since he was a child. Some of his favorite pieces have been 
      found on the soundtrack of games developed by Nintendo. Beginning at an early age, he 
      started transcribing his favorite songs from games in the Animal Crossing, Pokémon, and 
      Mario franchises. After spending a couple years writing music for his YouTube channel, 
      he moved over to producing music for video games.</p>
