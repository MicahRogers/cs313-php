    <p>The Stormlight Archives: "Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently
 that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.
It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their
 Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into 
near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them."

  <div class="col-4 col-s-6"><img class="pingpong" src="pingpong.png" alt="Ping Pong"><p>Ping Pong: My parents got a ping pong table when I was young. I mostly played with 
my older brother. A kew part of playing against my brother is the good-natured trash talk. It is pretty much non-stop and some people who overhear us probaby think we hate 
each other</p></div>
  <div class="col-4 col-s-6"><img src="boardgame.png" alt="Board Games"> <p>Board Games: I enjoy getting together with friends to play board games.
Since i can tend to be a little competetive, I prefer to play cooperative board games. Some of my favorites are Mansions of Madness, 
Spirit Island, and Pandemic</p></div>
